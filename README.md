# Introduction

Hello My name is Hussam Ra'id Alraggad and I am a *Front-End Flutter Developer* and I am passionate about learning *UX/UI Design and Research*.

As a software developer having a good mindset is practice towards achieving your goals. There is nothing valuable in life that is easy earn or achieve we must put effort into what we want to reach.

One of my best practice I would go with through my profession is that whenever i face a problem I leave it to set in the back my head for a while this may help me analyzing the problem not underestimating my self and oversize the problem, the next step is to ***Devide and Conquer*** which is a concept i learned back in the university days that means to divide problem into small problems like this you can see more of the problem than befre and it's eaier to solve.

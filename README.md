As a software developer having a good mindset is a good practice towards achieving your goals. There is nothing valuable in life that is easy earn or achieve, we must put effort into what we want to reach.

One of my best practices I would go with through my profession is that whenever I face a problem I leave it to set in the back my head for a while this may help me analyzing the problem not underestimating my self and oversize the problem, the next step is to ***Devide and Conquer*** which is a concept I learned back in the university days that means to divide the problem into small problems, like this you can see more of the problem than befre and it's eaier to solve.

Here's some of my ineterests and hobbies:
